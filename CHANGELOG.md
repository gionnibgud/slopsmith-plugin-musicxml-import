## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Compound and irregular meter beat emission. Beat ticks in `song_timeline.json`
  now use the primary beat unit (dotted quarter for 6/8, 9/8, 12/8) rather than
  the quarter note. `beat_groups` is written onto compound/irregular measure dicts;
  `beat_pos` is written onto every non-downbeat notation beat.
- `beat_pos` reduced to lowest terms via `gcd` — denominator is now `ts_beat_type`
  or a simpler fraction (e.g. `[1, 4]` for beat 2 in 4/4, not `[4, 16]`).
- Output filename no longer doubles the `_mxml` suffix when the title extracted
  from the MusicXML already ends with the word "mxml".
- `<wavy-line>` vibrato now tracked as a span. Previously `vib: True` was
  emitted only on the note carrying `<wavy-line type="start">`. Now a
  `vibrato_open` tracker applies `vib: True` to every beat from start through
  stop inclusive, including across measure boundaries.
- `song_timeline` sections now carry a `number` field (1-based per-name counter).
  Previously all sections defaulted to repeat #0.
- `alter` now uses `round()` instead of `int(float())` to avoid truncation of
  near-integer MusicXML alter values from imprecise exporters.
- `ws://` in `screen.js` replaced with a protocol-relative conditional (`wss`
  on HTTPS deployments).
- `load_sibling('mxml2notation')` resolved once at `setup()` time instead of
  per-request.
- `gp2midi` imported at module level with an `ImportError` fallback instead of
  inside the build thread.
- `asyncio.get_running_loop()` replaces deprecated `get_event_loop()`.
- `traceback.print_exc()` replaced with `_log.exception()`.
- Metadata indexing failure now logs a warning instead of silently passing.
- MIDI and upload temp dirs cleaned up via `shutil.rmtree` in a `finally` block.

### Added

- `requirements` field in `plugin.json` (`midiutil`, `pyyaml`) for
  self-installation outside the slopsmith container environment.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- `mxml2notation.py` — MusicXML to notation wire format conversion library.
  Produces `notation_<id>.json` (notation format v1) and `song_timeline.json`
  per the sloppak spec §5.3 (requires `feat/notation-format` branch or later).
- `routes.py` — FastAPI backend: `POST /api/plugins/musicxml_import/upload`
  and `WS /ws/plugins/musicxml_import/build`.
- `screen.html` / `screen.js` — drag-and-drop import UI with progress reporting.
- `plugin.json` — plugin manifest (`private: true`, nav entry).
- `CONTEXT.md` — pipeline description, limitations, dependency map.
- `LICENSE` — MIT.
- `README.md` — install instructions and compatibility note.

### Known limitations

- First part only — multi-part scores import only part 1.
- Grace notes appear in the notation score but are absent from MIDI audio.
- `grace_slash` field recorded but not yet acted on by any renderer.
- No repeat / da capo / segno expansion.
- No `.mxl` (compressed MusicXML) support.
